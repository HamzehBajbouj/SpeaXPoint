The AllocatedPlayerQuickSearch, 
this collection is separated from the sub-collection AllocatedRolePlayers, it almost has the same data almost 
but with the deletion of some of it.
why we have it in the first place ? doesn't that mean we have redundant data?
yes, the reason is because there was a poor design for the firestore database and because of the decision taken
I ended up have such a case, I can solve it by making the AllocatedRolePlayers as a collection alone not as sub-collection
and the reason i can't because i need a unique id for each document in the AllocatedRolePlayers. 
and also because it's tightly related to chapterMeeting collection so i thought it's better to keep it 
as a sub-collection.


now what is the purpose of AllocatedPlayerQuickSearch?
the main purpose it will play as quick search collection, becuase if i want to search for a certain rolePlayer in the AllocatedRolePlayers
it would be so much expensive as i need first to download the chapterMeeting documents and loop through them which 
will create hundred if not thousands of API reuqests.
the second purpose is solve another problem "beucase the first reason" which is sometimes when a member in club B 
joins a meeting in Club A, without this collection it would be difficult to search in all the chapterMeeting "due to the mentioned issue"
to find the meeting that Club B member has joined and then display them in the ScheduledMeeting Page.

operations on AllocatedPlayerQuickSearch?
the operations on coolection will occure in these cases:
1-when someone add the meeting into his ScheduledMeetings page from the Meeting Announcement from "add to schedule" button.
2-when managing the allocatedRolePlayers, when deleting, adding, updating the role player allocation, it's always the same operations happens to the AllocatedPlayerQuickSearch as in AllocatedRolePlayers sub-collection.
3-when delete the entire session in the ManageComingSessions page, all the documents related to the session/chpaterMeeting must be deleted. "currently we don't have this option in the manageComingSessions"
